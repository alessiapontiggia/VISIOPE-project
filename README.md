# VISIOPE-project

Since the dataset used is self-generated and randomic, you can:

0) OPEN THE COLAB AND VISUALIZE IT (WITHOUT RUNNING)
1) USE THE SAME DATASET ON WHICH THE PROJECT HAS BEEN RUN
2) GENERATE ANOTHER DATASET AND TRY IT BY YOUR OWN

FOLLOW THIS PROCEDURE FOR THE FIRST OPTION (USE THE SAME DATASET ON WHICH THE PROJECT HAS BEEN RUN):

1) Go to the following link https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1dd4yAs1-IamxgJkx94fv9Zgh1AEDB2xy?usp=share_link 
   
   You should see this:

2) Copy this folder VISIOPE and paste it to your own Google Drive (under "MyDrive" or "Il mio Drive")

   You should see something like this:
  
   ![drive](https://github.com/alessiapontiggia/VISIOPE-project/assets/102748217/dc01063c-cbeb-43cf-9c12-bf3cc317f669)
  
 
3) Open the Google Colab Notebook and run each cell code 
   
   (except the one who has this signature as comment #DON'T COMPILE ...). These are reported below:

FOLLOW THIS PROCEDURE FOR THE SECOND OPTION (GENERATE ANOTHER DATASET AND TRY IT BY YOUR OWN)

1) Open your Google Drive
2) Under your MyDrive or "Il Mio Drive" create these folders:
    VISIOPE
      - dataset
      - test 
        - Goal
        - No_Goal
      - test_set
      - training
        - Goal
        - No_Goal
      - val_set
      - validation
        - Goal
        - No_Goal
   
   You should get something like this:

3) Open the Google Colab Notebook and run each cell
4) To complete the generation of the dataset and the test operations wait some minutes in order to store everything in the right folders
